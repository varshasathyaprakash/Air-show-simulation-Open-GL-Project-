# ‚úàÔ∏è Air Show Simulation (Computer Graphics Project)

This project is a **Computer Graphics simulation of an Air Show** built using **C++ and OpenGL**.  
It was developed as part of a Computer Graphics project to demonstrate animation, transformations, and rendering techniques in OpenGL.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Simulates an **Air Show** with flying airplanes.  
- Implements **basic animation** using OpenGL functions.  
- Demonstrates **translation, rotation, scaling** and other graphics transformations.  
- Built in **C++ with OpenGL libraries**.  
- Runs on **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** (can also be adapted to other compilers with OpenGL setup).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **C++**  
- **OpenGL (GLUT/GLU/GL)**  
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1. Install **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** (or a compatible version with OpenGL configured).  
2. Setup OpenGL libraries:  
   - `glut.h`  
   - `glu32.lib`  
   - `opengl32.lib`  
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varshasathyaprakash/Air-show-simulation-Open-GL-Project.git
4. Open the project in Visual Studio.
5. Build and Run ‚Äì the simulation will start with animated airplanes.
